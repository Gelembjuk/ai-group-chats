# Group Chat with AI

A collection of experimental applications exploring multi-user interactions with AI chatbots and agents. Each project investigates different approaches to enabling multiple users to communicate with the same AI agent in group chat scenarios.

## Projects

### [group_in_one_room_with_ai](./group_in_one_room_with_ai)

An AI agent that listens to group conversations from JSON files and can optionally respond when it has something valuable to contribute. Built with Python, LangChain, and OpenAI, this project simulates group chat scenarios where the AI agent observes messages, maintains context, and decides when to participate in the conversation.

**Key Features:**
- JSON-based conversation processing
- Context-aware AI responses
- LangChain integration for flexible LLM provider support
- CLI interface with configuration via environment variables
